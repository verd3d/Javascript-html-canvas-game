# Javascript-html-canvas-game
This is my first try at a javascript html canvas game. I basically followed Chris Courses' (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Yp2yz6-pwhQuPlIDV_mjA) tutorial and changed up a few values and colors along the way.

Hopefully I'll expand on it with my own knowledge, I have a few ideas, for example adding movement with WASD and a few powerpups pickup-bubbles that spawn randomly on the canvas (timeslow, firerate increase, decrease radius, etc.)
